|===

GSQL running on the TigerGraph platform is particularly well-suited for graph algorithms for several reasons:

* *Turing-complete* with full support for imperative and procedural programming, ideal for algorithmic computation.
* *Parallel and Distributed Processing,* enabling computations on larger graphs.
* *User-Extensible*. Because the algorithms are written in standard GSQL and compiled by the user,  they are easy to modify and customize.
* *Open-Source*. Users can study the GSQL implementations to learn by example, and they can develop and submit additions to the library.

=== Release Branches

Starting with TigerGraph product version 2.6, the GSQL Graph Algorithm Library has release branches:

* *Product version branches* (2.6, 3.0, etc.) are snapshots created shortly after a product version is released.They contain the best version of the graph algorithm library at the time of that product version's initial release.They will not be updated, except to fix bugs.
* *Master branch*: the newest released version.This should be at least as new as the newest.It may contain new or improved algorithms.
* Other branches are development branches.

It is possible to run newer algorithms on an older product version, as long as the algorithm does not rely on features available only in newer product versions.
