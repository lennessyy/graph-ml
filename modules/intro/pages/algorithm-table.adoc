= Algorithm Availability and Dependencies

The following table lists several key characteristics of each algorithm,

Besides these requirements, each algorithm is designed to work with certain types of graph data, such as directed edges vs. undirected edges. Those data-driven requirements are listed with each algorithm.

*Maturity* - The maturity of an algorithm is one of three classifications:

* *Alpha* = basic functionality and testing
* *Beta* = full-featured, well-tested
* *Production* = full-featured, stable, rigorously tested, optimized for speed and resource efficiency, suitable for production use

*GraphStudio* - Availability for easy installation as one of
xref:gui:graphstudio:write-queries.adoc#_create_a_query_or_add_a_query_from_the_algorithm_library[GraphStudio's preloaded algorithms].

*Packaged Template* - Availability in TigerGraph's built-in package of templated algorithms with just-in-time compilation.

*UDF Required* - This algorithm requires the installation of a custom user-defined function (UDF).
If installed by GraphStudio or as a packaged template query, the UDF will be taken care of automatically.

[NOTE]
====
For security reasons, the ability to install a UDF is disabled by default.
Your system administrator can enable this capability if appropriate.
====

*Subquery Required* - This algorithm requires the installation of a custom subquery.
