= Community Algorithms
:description: Overview of community algorithms.

Community algorithms group together vertices or edges that satisfy some rule for being connected to one another. This is different from clustering or xref:classification-algorithms:index.adoc[classification] in general, because those types of categorization do not necessarily consider connections.

The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following community algorithms:

** xref:wcc-small-world.adoc[]
* xref:k-core-decomposition.adoc[]
* xref:label-propagation.adoc[]
* xref:slpa.adoc[]
