= K-Core Decomposition

A *k-core* of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph in which every vertex is connected to at least k vertices in the subgraph. To obtain the k-core of a graph, the algorithm first deletes the vertices whose outdegree is less than _k_. It then updates the outdegree of the neighbors of the deleted vertices, and if that causes a vertex's outdegree to fall below _k_, it will also delete that vertex. The algorithm repeats this operation until every vertex left in the subgraph has an outdegree of at least _k_.

Our algorithm takes a range of values for _k_ and returns the set of the vertices that constitute the k-core with the highest possible value of _k_ within the range. It is an implementation of Algorithm 2 in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622056[Scalable K-Core Decomposition for Static Graphs Using a Dynamic Graph Data Structure, Tripathy et al., IEEE Big Data 2018].

== Time complexity

O(E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.

== Parameters

|===
| Parameter | Description

| `v_type`
| Vertex type to include in the k-core

| `e_type`
| Edge type to count for k-core connections

| `k_min`
| Minimum value of k. If the actual maximum core is below `k_min`, the algorithm will return an empty set.

| `k_max`
| Maximum value of k. If `k_max` is smaller than `k_min`, the algorithm will ignore this parameter and keep looking for k-cores until it reaches a value of k where a k-core cannot be found.

| `show_membership`
| If `show_membership` is `true`, the algorithm will return the k-cores found for every value of k within the range provided. For each k-core, the results will include its member vertices.

| `show_shells`
| The _*k*_*-shell* is the set of vertices that are part of the _k_-core but not part of the (_k_+1)-core. If `show_shells` is `true`, the algorithm will return the k-shells found for every value of k. within the range provided. For each k-shell, the results will include its member vertices.

| `print_accum`
| Boolean value that decides whether the algorithm will return output in JSON

| `attr`
| Optional. An attribute of the vertex to save the core level of the vertex to. If `attr` is provided, the core level of the vertex will be saved to this attribute of the vertex.

| `file_path`
| Optional. If `file_path` is provided, the algorithm will output results to a file specified by the file path in CSV format.

== Example

In the example below based on the https://docs.tigergraph.com/start/gsql-101/get-set#GSQL101-DataSet[`social`] graph from GSQL 101, we can see that Dan, Tom, and Jenny make up a 2-core, which is the max-core of the graph:

If we run the `kcore` algorithm on this small graph like so:

----
RUN QUERY tg_kcore("person", "friendship", 0, -1, TRUE, "", "", FALSE, FALSE)
----

Here is the returned JSON response, which includes a 2-core that is comprised of Dan, Jenny, and Tom:
