****

A *k-core* of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph in which every vertex is connected to at least stem:[k] vertices in the subgraph.

This algorithm takes a range of values for stem:[k] and returns the vertex set that constitutes the k-core with the highest possible value of stem:[k] within the range.


To obtain the k-core of a graph, the algorithm first deletes the vertices whose outdegree is less than _k_. It then updates the outdegree of the neighbors of the deleted vertices, and if that causes a vertex's outdegree to fall below _k_, it will also delete that vertex. The algorithm repeats this operation until every vertex left in the subgraph has an outdegree of at least _k_.


== Notes

This is an implementation of Algorithm 2 in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622056[Scalable K-Core Decomposition for Static Graphs Using a Dynamic Graph Data Structure, Tripathy et al., IEEE Big Data 2018].

== Time complexity

stem:[O(E)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges in the graph.

== Specifications

[source,gsql]
----
tg_kcore(STRING v_type, STRING e_type, INT k_min = 0,
  INT k_max = -1, BOOL print_accum = TRUE,
  STRING result_attr = "", STRING file_path = "",
  BOOL print_all_k = FALSE, BOOL show_shells=FALSE)

== Parameters

|===
| Parameter | Description

| `STRING v_type`
| Vertex type to include in the k-core

| `STRING e_type`
| Edge type to count for k-core connections

| `INT k_min`
| Minimum value of k. If the actual maximum core is below `k_min`, the algorithm will return an empty set.

| `INT k_max`
| Maximum value of k. If `k_max` is smaller than `k_min`, the algorithm will ignore this parameter and keep looking for k-cores until it reaches a value of k where a k-core cannot be found.

| `BOOL print_accum`
| Boolean value that decides whether the algorithm will return output in JSON

| `STRING result_attr`
| An attribute of the vertex to save the core level of the vertex to. If `attr` is provided, the core level of the vertex will be saved to this attribute of the vertex.

| `STRING file_path`
| If `file_path` is provided, the algorithm will output results to a file specified by the file path in CSV format.

| `BOOL print_all_k`
| Whether to print all _k_ connections

| `BOOL show_shells`
| The *k-shell* is the set of vertices that are part of the _k_-core but not part of the (_k_+1)-core. If `show_shells` is `true`, the algorithm will return the k-shells found for every value of k. within the range provided. For each k-shell, the results will include its member vertices.

== Example

In the example below based on the `social` graph from GSQL 101, we can see that Dan, Tom, and Jenny make up a 2-core, which is the max-core of the graph:

If we run the `kcore` algorithm on this small graph like so:

[source,gsql]
----
RUN QUERY tg_kcore("person", "friendship", 0, -1, TRUE, "", "", FALSE, FALSE)
----

Here is the returned JSON response, which includes a 2-core that is comprised of Dan, Jenny, and Tom:
