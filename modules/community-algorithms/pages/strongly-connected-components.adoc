= Strongly Connected Components

Algorithm link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Community/connected_components/strongly_connected_components[Strongly Connected Components]

A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph such that there is a path from any vertex to every other vertex. A graph can contain more than one separate SCC. An SCC algorithm finds the maximal SCCs within a graph.

Our implementation is based on the Divide-and-Conquer Strong Components (DCSC) algorithm[1]. In each iteration, pick a pivot vertex `v` randomly, and find its descendant and predecessor sets, where descendant set `D_v` is the vertex reachable from `v`, and predecessor set `P_v` is the vertices which can reach `v` (stated another way, reachable from `v` through reverse edges). The intersection of these two sets is a strongly connected component `SCC_v`.

The graph can be partitioned into 4 sets: `SCC_v`, descendants `D_v` excluding `SCC_v`, predecessors `P_v` excluding `SCC`, and the remainders `R_v`. It is proved that _any SCC_ is a subset of one of the 4 sets [1]. Thus, we can divide the graph into different subsets and detect the SCCs independently and iteratively.

The problem of this algorithm is unbalanced load and slow convergence when there are a lot of small SCCs, which is often the case in real-world use cases [3]. We added two trimming stages to improve the performance: size-1 SCC trimming[2] and weakly connected components[3].

The implementation of this algorithm requires reverse edges for all directed edges considered in the graph.

The first element `"i"=1` means the whole graph is processed in just one iteration. The 5 `"trim_set.size()"` elements mean there were 5 rounds of size-1 SCC trimming. The final `"@@.cluster_dist_heap" object"` reports on the size distribution of SCCs.

There is one SCC with 9 vertices, and 17 SCCs with only 1 vertex in the graph.
