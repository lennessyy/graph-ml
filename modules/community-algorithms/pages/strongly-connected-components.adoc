A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph such that there is a path from any vertex to every other vertex.
A graph can contain more than one separate SCC.
This SCC algorithm finds the maximal SCCs within a graph.

Our implementation is based on the Divide-and-Conquer Strong Components (DCSC) algorithm:

* In each iteration, pick a pivot vertex `v` randomly.
* Find its descendant and predecessor sets:
** Descendant set `D_v` is the set of vertices reachable from `v` using regular edges.
** Predecessor set `P_v` is the set of vertices reachable from `v` using reverse edges.
* The intersection of these two sets is a strongly connected component `SCC_v`.

The graph can be partitioned into 4 sets:

* `SCC_v`
* Descendants `D_v` excluding `SCC_v`
* Predecessors `P_v` excluding `SCC_v`
* Remainders `R_v`.

It is proved that _any SCC_ is a subset of one of the 4 sets.

Thus, we can divide the graph into different subsets and detect the SCCs independently and iteratively.

== Notes

The implementation of this algorithm requires reverse edges for all directed edges considered in the graph.

The problem of this algorithm is unbalanced load and slow convergence when there are a lot of small SCCs, which is often the case in real-world use cases.

We added two trimming stages to improve the performance: Size-1 SCC Trimming and Weakly Connected Components.

== Results

Assigns a component id (INT) to each vertex, such that members
of the same component have the same ID value.


== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(k * d)], where stem:[k] is equal to the number of iterations and stem:[d] is equal to the maximum component diameter.

== Example

Consider a graph with Person vertices and Friend and Coworker edges.
The following illustration shows a group of these vertices and edges.
Not shown are a number of other vertices that have no connection to other vertices.

We run the SCC query with default values, making sure to include both types of edges in the query.


A portion of the JSON result is shown below.

The  `@@.cluster_dist_heap` object reports on the size distribution of SCCs.

There is one SCC with 9 vertices, and 17 SCCs with only 1 vertex in the graph.
