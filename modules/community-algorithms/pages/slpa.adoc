****

The Speaker-listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) is a variation of the Label Propagation algorithm that is able to detect overlapping communities.
The main difference between LPA and SLPA is that each node can only hold a single label in LPA while it is allowed to possess multiple labels in SLPA.

The algorithm begins with each vertex having its own unique label. It then iteratively records labels in a local accumulator based on specific speaking and listening rules.
Then the post-processing of the record labels is applied.
Finally, the algorithm removes the nested communities and outputs all the communities. Note that it is not guaranteed to produce the same results every time.

=== Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Default

|`SET<STRING> v_type_set`
|The vertex types to use
|(empty set of strings)

|`SET<STRING> e_type_set`
|The edge types to use
|(empty set of strings)

|`FLOAT threshold`
|The threshold to drop a label
|0

|`INT maximum_iteration`
|The maximum number of iterations
|10

|`BOOL print_results`
|Whether to print the output in JSON format
|False

|`STRING file_path`
|The file to write the output to in CSV format

=== Output

Assigns a list of component IDs in INT form to each vertex, such that members of the same component have the same ID value.

The result size is equal to stem:[V], the number of vertices.


=== Time complexity
This algorithm has a complexity of stem:[O(E*k)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of iterations.


== Example

In the example below, we run the `+tg_slpa+` algorithm on the social10 graph. We set maximum_iteration = 10 and threshold = 0.1.

The result shows that each community has a unique community ID in the `com` attribute.
