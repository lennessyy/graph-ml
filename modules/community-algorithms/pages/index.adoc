= Community Algorithms
:description: Overview of community algorithms.

Community algorithms group together vertices or edges that satisfy some rule for being connected to one another. Community algorithms are different from clustering or xref:classification-algorithms:index.adoc[classification] algorithms because clustering and classification do not necessarily consider connections.

The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following community algorithms:
