Algorithm link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Topological%20Link%20Prediction/total_neighbors[Total Neighbors]

****
The algorithm counts the total number of neighbors, or vertices connected by one hop, of two vertices.

== Notes

This algorithm ignores edge weights.

== Specifications
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_total_neighbors(VERTEX a, VERTEX b,
    SET<STRING> e_type)
----

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(D1 + D2)], where stem:[D1] and stem:[D2] are the degrees of the two vertices.

=== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Default value

| `VERTEX a`
|  The first vertex to compare.
|  N/A

| `VERTEX b`
| The second vertex to compare with the first.
| N/A

| `SET<STRING> e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| (an empty set of strings)
|===

== Return value
The total number of neighbors of two vertices as a `closeness` value.

== Example
Suppose we have the following graph.

image::preferential-attachment-ex.png[]

Dan and Jenny together have 6 neighbors in total.

Dan's neighbors are:

* Nancy
* Kevin
* Tom
* Jenny

and Jenny's neighbors are:

* Dan
* Tom
* Amily

Running the algorithm with input vertices of `Dan` and `Jenny` would give us a result of `6` because the connection Dan - Jenny and Jenny - Dan is not double-counted.
