= Total Neighbors

Algorithm link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Topological%20Link%20Prediction/total_neighbors[Total Neighbors]

The algorithm calculates the total number of neighbors of two vertices.

== Specifications
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_total_neighbors(VERTEX a, VERTEX b,
    SET<STRING> e_type)
----

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(D1 + D2)], where _D1_ and _D2_ are the degrees of the two vertices.

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| `SET<STRING>`
|===

== Return value
The total number of neighbors of two vertices.

== Example
Suppose we have the following graph.

image::preferential-attachment-ex.png[]

Dan and Jenny together have 6 neighbors in total. Running the algorithm between Dan and Jenny would give us a result of 6. Note that since Jenny and Dan are neighbors themselves, the union of their neighbors includes both Jenny and Dan:
