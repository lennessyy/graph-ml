= Topological Link Prediction Algorithms
:description: Overview of link prediction algorithms.

Topological link prediction algorithms determine the closeness score of a pair of vertices. This score can then be used to make predictions about the relationships between the two vertices in the pair.

The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following link prediction algorithms:
