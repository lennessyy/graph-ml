= Common Neighbors

The common neighbors algorithm calculates the number of common neighbors between two vertices.

== Specification
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_common_neighbors(VERTEX a, VERTEX b, SET<STRING> e_type)
----

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| `SET<STRING>`
|===

== Return value
The number of common neighbors between two vertices.

== Example
Suppose to have the following graph:

image::adamic-adar-ex.png[]

Running the algorithm between Dan and Jenny will show that they have 1 common neighbor.
