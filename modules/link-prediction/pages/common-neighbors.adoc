Algorithm Link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Topological%20Link%20Prediction/common_neighbors[Common Neighbors]

****

A vertex stem:[A] that is connected to vertices stem:[B] and stem:[C] is considered to be a "common neighbor" of stem:[B] and stem:[C].

The common neighbors algorithm counts the number of common neighbors between two vertices.

== Notes

This algorithm ignores edge weights.

== Specifications
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_common_neighbors(VERTEX a, VERTEX b, SET<STRING> e_type)
----

== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(D1 + D2)], where stem:[D1] and stem:[D2] are the degrees of the two vertices.

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Default value

| `VERTEX a`
|  The first vertex to compare.
| N/A

| `VERTEX b`
| The second vertex to compare with the first.
| N/A

| `SET<STRING> e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| (A blank set of strings)
|===

== Results
Returns the number of common neighbors between two vertices expressed as a `closeness` value.

== Example
Suppose we have the following graph:

image::adamic-adar-ex.png[]

Running the algorithm between Dan and Jenny shows that they have 1 common neighbor.
