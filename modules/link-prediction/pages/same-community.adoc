= Same Community

This algorithm takes two vertices, and returns 1 if they two vertices are in the same community, and returns 0 if they are not in the same community.

NOTE: The algorithm assumes that community detection has already completed and that a community ID is stored in an integer attribute on each vertex.

CREATE QUERY tg_same_community(VERTEX a, VERTEX b, STRING
    communityAttribute)

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `communityAttribute`
| The community attribute used to store a vertex's community ID.
| `STRING`
|===


== Return value

* Returns 1 if the two vertices are in the same community.
* Returns 0 if the two vertices are not in the same community.

== Example
Suppose we have the following vertices:

image::same-community-ex.png[]

Their community IDs were generated by running the weakly connected component algorithm on the graph. If we run the algorithm between Kevin and Jenny, we get 1 because the two vertices are in the same community as indicated by their `community` attribute:
