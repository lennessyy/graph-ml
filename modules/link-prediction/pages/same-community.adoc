****

The Same Community algorithm is a simple boolean algorithm to check whether two vertices share the same community labeling.

This algorithm takes two vertices as input, returning 1 if the two vertices are in the same community, and returning 0 if they are not in the same community.

== Notes

The algorithm assumes that a community ID is stored in an integer attribute on each vertex.
For this to happen, usually a xref:community-algorithms:index.adoc[Community Detection] algorithm is run to create such community IDs.

This algorithm ignores edge weights.

CREATE QUERY tg_same_community(VERTEX a, VERTEX b, STRING

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(1)].

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `communityAttribute`
| The community attribute used to store a vertex's community ID.
| `STRING`

== Return value

* Returns 1 if the two vertices are in the same community.
* Returns 0 if the two vertices are not in the same community.

== Example
Suppose we have the following vertices:

image::same-community-ex.png[]

Their community IDs were generated by running the xref:community-algorithms:connected-components.adoc[] algorithm on the graph.
If we run the algorithm between Kevin and Jenny, we get 1 because the two vertices are in the same community as indicated by their `community` attribute:
