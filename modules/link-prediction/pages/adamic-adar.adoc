Algorithm link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Topological%20Link%20Prediction/adamic_adar[Adamic Adar]

The Adamic/Adar index is a measure introduced in 2003 by Lada Adamic and Eytan Adar to predict links in a social network, according to the number of shared links between two nodes.
It is defined as the sum of the inverse logarithmic degree centrality of the neighbors shared by the two nodes.

{A(x,y)=\sum _{u\in N(x)\cap N(y)}{\frac {1}{\log {|N(u)|}}}}
++++
Where stem:[{N(u)}] is the set of nodes adjacent to _u_.

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(D1 + D2)], where stem:[D1] and stem:[D2] are the degrees of the two vertices.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| `SET<STRING>`
|===

== Return value
The Adamic Adar index between two vertices. If the two vertices do not have common neighbors, the algorithm will return a division by 0 error.

== Example
Suppose we have the graph below:

image::adamic-adar-ex.png[]

Running the algorithm between Jenny and Dan will give us a result of stem:[1/\log(2) = 3.32193].
