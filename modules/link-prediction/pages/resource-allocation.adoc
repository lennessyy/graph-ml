****


Resource Allocation is used to compute the closeness of nodes based on their shared neighbors. It is computed by the following formula:

[stem]
++++
{RA(x,y)=\sum _{u\in N(x)\cap N(y)}{\frac {1} {|N(u)|}}}
++++
Where stem:[{N(u)}] is the set of nodes adjacent to _u_.

== Notes

This algorithm ignores edge weights.

== Specifications

----
CREATE QUERY tg_resource_allocation(VERTEX a, VERTEX b, SET<STRING> e_type)
----

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(D1 + D2)], where stem:[D1] and stem:[D2] are the degrees of the two vertices.

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| `SET<STRING>`
|===

== Example
Suppose we have the following graph:

image::preferential-attachment-ex.png[]

Dan and Jenny have one shared neighbor `Tom`, who has two neighbors.
Running the algorithm between Dan and Jenny with `friendship` edges returns a result of `0.5`.
