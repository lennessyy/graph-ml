= Preferential Attachment
:stem: latex

Preferential Attachment is a measure to compute the closeness of vertices, based on the number of their neighbors. The algorithm returns the product two vertices' number of neighbors.

For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment[Preferential Attachment].

== Specification
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_preferential_attachment(VERTEX a, VERTEX b,
    SET<STRING> e_type)
----

== Parameters
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Name | Description | Data type

| `a`
|  A vertex.
|  `VERTEX`

| `b`
| A vertex.
| `VERTEX`

| `e_type`
| Edge types to traverse.
| `SET<STRING>`
|===

== Return value
The product of the number of neighbors of the two vertices.

== Example
Suppose we have the following graph:

image::preferential-attachment-ex.png[]

Since Dan has four neighbors, while Jenny has three, the return value of the algorithm is stem:[3*4=12].
