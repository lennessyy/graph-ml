= Overlap Similarity
:stem: latex

The *overlap coefficient*, or *Szymkiewiczâ€“Simpson coefficient*, is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_measure[similarity measure]
that measures the overlap between two finite sets.

{overlap} (X,Y)={\frac {|X\cap Y|}{\min(|X|,|Y|)}}
++++

The algorithm takes two vectors denoted by `+ListAccum+` and returns the
overlap coefficient between them.

NOTE: This algorithm is implemented as a user-defined function. You need to
follow the steps in link:[Add a User-Defined Function] to add the
function to GSQL. After adding the function, you can call it in any GSQL
query in the same way as a built-in GSQL function.

== Specification

....
tg_overlap_similarity_accum( A, B )
....

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a complexity of stem:[O(n)], where _n_ is the number of dimensions of the vectors.

== Parameters

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Description |Data type
|`+A+` |An n-dimensional vector denoted by a `+ListAccum+` of length
`+n+` |`+ListAccum<INT/UINT/FLOAT/DOUBLE>+`

|`+B+` |An n-dimensional vector denoted by a `+ListAccum+` of length
`+n+` |`+ListAccum<INT/UINT/FLOAT/DOUBLE>+`
|===

== Return value

The overlap coefficient between the two vectors.
