= Similarity Algorithms
:description: Overview of similarity algorithms.

Similarity algorithms assign a score to a pair of vertices based on how similar they are.
This usually involves seeing if they have the same or similar neighborhoods.
This section also includes distance algorithms, as distance is the inverse of similarity.
