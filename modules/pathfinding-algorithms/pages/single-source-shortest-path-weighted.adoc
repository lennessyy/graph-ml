****


Finding shortest paths in a graph with weighted edges is algorithmically harder than in an unweighted graph because even after you find a path to a vertex T, you cannot be certain that it is a shortest path. If edge weights are always positive, then you must keep trying until you have considered every in-edge to T. If edge weights can be negative, then it's even harder. You must consider all possible paths.

A classic application for weighted shortest path is finding the shortest travel route to get from A to B. (Think of route planning "GPS" apps.) In general, any application where you are looking for the cheapest route is a possible fit.

== Specifications

The shortest path algorithm can be optimized if we know all the weights are nonnegative. If there can be negative weights, then sometimes a longer path will have a lower cumulative weight. Therefore, we have two versions of this algorithm

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(V*E)], where stem:[V] is equal to the number of vertices and stem:[E] is equal to the number of edges.

[NOTE]
====
The shortest_path_any_wt query is an implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. If there is more than one path with the same total weight, the algorithm returns one of them.

Currently, shortest_path_pos_wt also uses Bellman-Ford. The well-known Dijsktra's algorithm is designed for serial computation and cannot work with GSQL's parallel processing.

== Example

The graph below has only positive edge weights. Using vertex A as the source vertex, the algorithm discovers that the shortest weighted path from A to B is A-D-B, with distance 8. The shortest weighted path from A to C is A-D-B-C with distance 9.
