****

Finding shortest paths in a graph with weighted edges is algorithmically harder than in an unweighted graph because even after you find one path to a vertex T, you cannot be certain that it is a shortest path.

If edge weights are always positive, then you must keep trying until you have considered every in-edge to T. If edge weights can be negative, then it's even harder. You must consider all possible paths.

A classic application for a weighted shortest path algorithm is finding the shortest travel route to get from an origin location to a destination location.
In this case, the edge weights would be the distances between vertices.
In general, any application where you are looking for the cheapest route is a possible fit.

== Notes

If you have edges with positive weights, use `shortest_path_pos_wt`, which is based on the delta-stepping approach, to take advantage of TigerGraph's parallel processing.
The well-known Dijsktra's algorithm is not well-suited for parallel computation.

If you have edges with both positive and negative weights, use `shortest_path_any_wt`, which implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
If there is more than one path with the same total weight, the algorithm returns one of them.



== Specifications

The shortest path algorithm can be optimized if we know all the weights are non-negative. If there can be negative weights, then sometimes a longer path will have a lower cumulative weight. Therefore, we have two versions of this algorithm

=== Output

Computes a shortest distance (given in `INT` format) and a shortest path (`STRING`) from a given _source_ vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

Returns a result size of stem:[V], the number of vertices in the graph.

=== Time complexity
For a graph with positive weight edges, the time complexity is approximately stem:[O(V+E)], where stem:[V] is equal to the number of vertices and stem:[E] is equal to the number of edges.

For a graph with positive and negative weight edges, the time complexity is stem:[O(V*E)].

== Example

The graph below has only positive edge weights. Using vertex A as the source vertex, the algorithm discovers that the shortest weighted path from A to B is A-D-B, with distance 8. The shortest weighted path from A to C is A-D-B-C with distance 9.
