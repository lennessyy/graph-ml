****

A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm
that uses heuristics to estimate the most efficient path.

As it traverses the graph, A* estimates the total cost of a path using each node on the way to the target.

The best path is calculated by minimizing the function stem:[f(n)=g(n)+h(n)], where:

* stem:[n] is the next node on the path
* stem:[g(n)] is the cost of the path from the source node to stem:[n]
* stem:[h(n)] is a heuristic function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from stem:[n] to the target node.

The algorithm terminates when the path it chooses to extend is a path
from start to goal or if there are no paths eligible to be extended.
The heuristic function is problem-specific.
If the heuristic function is admissible, meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get
to the target, the algorithm is guaranteed to return a least-cost path from source to target.

== Notes

The A* algorithm is relatively inefficient in terms of worst-case time and space complexity.

=== Output
Computes a shortest distance (in `INT` format) and shortest path (`STRING`) from the source to the target vertex.


=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(V^2)], where stem:[V] is equal to the number of vertices.


== Example

We run the `+tg_astar+` algorithm to find the shortest path between the source vertex "Kings Cross" and the target vertex "Kentish Town" on a graph which is a transport network of stations.

Each station has its geometric attibutes(i.e.latitude and longitude) and the edge weight represents the distance between stations in kilometers.

The heuristic function used to guide the search is the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula[Haversine Formula], which computes the distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.
