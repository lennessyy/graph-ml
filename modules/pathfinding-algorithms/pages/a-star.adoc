****



A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm,
which achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its
search.

The algorithm starts from a source node, and at each iteration of its
main loop, it selects the path that minimizes stem:[f(n)=g(n)+h(n)] where n is the next node on the path, g(n) is the
cost of the path from the source node to n, and h(n) is a heuristic
function that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to the
target node.

The algorithm terminates when the path it chooses to extend is a path
from start to goal or if there are no paths eligible to be extended.
The heuristic function is problem-specific.
If the heuristic function is admissible, meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get
to the target, the algorithm is guaranteed to return a least-cost path
from source to target.

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(V^2)], where stem:[V] is equal to the number of vertices.

== Example

In the example below, we run the `+tg_astar+` algorithm to find the shortest path between the source vertex "Kings Cross" and the target vertex "Kentish Town" on a graph which is a transport network of stations. Each station has its geometric attibutes(i.e.latitude and longitude) and the edge weight represents the distance between stations in kilometers.

The heuristic function used to guide the search is the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula[Haversine Formula], which computes the distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes

....
# Use _ for default values
RUN QUERY astar(("Kings Cross","Station"), ("Kentish Town","Station"),["CONNECTION"], "FLOAT", "distance", _)
....

Below is the visualized result of the query:
