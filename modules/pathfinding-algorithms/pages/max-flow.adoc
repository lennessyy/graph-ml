****

Flow is the concept of something moving from one vertex to another in a graph, such as money (in a financial graph), data (in a computer network), or even water (in a utility network).

A graph must have weighted edges to represent flow.

The maximum flow problem is to find the maximum possible flow from a source vertex to the target vertex.

Assuming a weighted graph where every edge has a capacity under the following constraints:

* Flow on an edge doesn't exceed the capacity of the edge.
* Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except `s` and `t`.

TigerGraph's implementation of the Maximum Flow algorithm is based on a modified version of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm[the Edmond-Karp algorithm].

== Use cases
The Maximum Flow algorithm has real world applications such as https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331967163_Airline_Scheduling_with_Max_Flow_algorithm[airline scheduling], and in solving https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/bioinfo-lectures/flowext.pdf[circulation-demand problems].

=== Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description

|`VERTEX source`
|Source vertex where the flow starts. Provide the vertex ID and type as a tuple: `("id","type")`

|`VERTEX sink`
|Target vertex where the flow is to be sent to. Provide the vertex ID and type as a tuple: `("id","type")`

|`SET<STRING> v_type_set`
|Vertex types to consider in the path.

|`SET<STRING> e_type_set`
|Edge types to traverse.

|`SET<STRING> reverse_e_type_set`
|Reverse edge types to traverse.

|`STRING cap_attr`
|Name of the attribute that contains the capacity of the edge.

|`STRING cap_type`
|Data type of the `cap_attr` attribute.

|`FLOAT min_flow_threshold`
|Minimum flow for an edge to carry if it is to carry any flow.

|`BOOL print_results`
|If true, output JSON to standard output.

|`BOOL display_edges`
|If true, the resulting path includes edges in addition to vertices.

|`BOOL split_to_file`
|If true, the file output will contain every edge and how much flow they would carry to achieve the maximum flow.

|`STRING file_path`
|If not empty, write output to this file.
|===

=== Output

JSON result::
The return value is the maximum flow that can be carried from the source to the sink.
If you set `display_edges` to true, the result will contain all edges that carry flow.
However, it does not output how much flow each edge carries to achieve the maximum flow.

CSV result::
The first line is the maximum flow that can be carried from the source to the sink.
If you set `split_to_file` to true, the result will contain all edges that carry flow as well as how much flow they carry to achieve maximum flow.


=== Time complexity

The time complexity of the Edmond-Karp algorithm is independent of maximum flow in the graph.
Here, the time complexity is stem:[O(VE^2)] where stem:[V] is the number of vertices and stem:[E] is the number of edges in the graph.

== Example

Suppose we have the following four areas `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` in a city.
Between each area is a pipeline that can be used to deliver water.

image::max-flow.png[]

If `a` is the source and `d` is the target (the sink), the maximum flow from `a` to `d` in this network is 51.
With the edge from `a` to `d` carrying 35, and the remaining edges each carrying 8.

If we run the max flow algorithm on this network, we will get the result that the maximum flow is from `a` to `d` is 51:
