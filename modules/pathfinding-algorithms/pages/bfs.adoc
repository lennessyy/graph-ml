****

Breadth-first Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to explore the vertices
of a graph layer by layer.
It starts at the given vertex and explores
all vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at
the next depth level.

== Specifications

[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_bfs( SET<STRING> v_type_set,  SET<STRING> e_type_set,INT max_hops=10,
    VERTEX v_start, BOOL print_results = True, STRING result_attribute = "",
    STRING file_path = "", BOOL display_edges = True)
----



=== Parameters

[cols="0,1,0",options="header",]
|===
|*Parameter* |Description |Default

|`SET<STRING> v_type_set`
|Vertex types to traverse
|(empty set of strings)

|`SET<STRING> e_type_set`
|Edge types to traverse
|(empty string)

|`INT max_hops`
|Maximum hops for the algorithm to look from each vertex
|10

|`VERTEX v_start`
|Source vertex for traversal. Provide the vertex ID and type as a tuple: `("id","type")`
|N/A

|`BOOL print_results`
|Whether to print JSON output
|True

|`STRING result_attribute`
|The vertex attribute to store results to in `INT` format
|(empty string)

|`STRING file_path`
|The path for a CSV output file
|(empty string)

|`BOOL display_edges`
|Whether to output edges for visualization
|False

|===

=== Output

Returns all the vertices that are accessible from the source vertex.

The result size is equal to stem:[V], or the number of vertices.

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(V+E)], where stem:[V] is equal to the number of vertices and stem:[E] is equal to the number of edges.


== Example

In the example below, we run the `+tg_bfs+` algorithm from the source vertex
`+alex+` on the social10 graph.

[source.wrap,gsql]
----
RUN QUERY tg_bfs(["Person"], ["Friend"], _, ("Alex","Person"), _, _, _, _) <1>
----
<1> Putting `_` in the position of a parameter will use the default value for that parameter.

Below is the visualized result of the query.
