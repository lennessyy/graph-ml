= Breadth-First Search

Breadth-first Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to explore the vertexes
of a graph layer by layer. It starts at the given vertex and explores
all vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at
the next depth level.

== Specifications

CREATE QUERY tg_bfs(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,INT max_hops=10,

|Characteristic |Value
|Result |Returns all the nodes that are accessible from the source
vertex

|Required Input Parameters
a|* `+v_type+`: vertex types to
traverse
* `+e_type+`: edge types to traverse
* `+max_hops+`: look only this far from each vertex
* `+v_start+`: source vertex for traversal
* `+print_accum+`: print JSON output
* `+result_attr+`: INT
attr to store results to
* `+file_path+`: file to write CSV output
to
* `+display_edges+`:output edges for visualization

|Result Size |V = number of vertices

|Time Complexity |O(E+V), E = number of edges, V = number of
vertices.since every vertex and every edge will be explored in the worst
case.

|Graph Types |Directed or Undirected edges, Weighted or Unweighted edges
|===

== Example

In the example below, we run `+tg_bfs+` algorithm from the source vertex
`+alex+` on the social10 graph.

....
# Use _ for default values
RUN QUERY tg_bfs(["Person"], ["Friend"], _, ("Alex","Person"), _, _, _, _)
....

Below is the visualized result of the query:
