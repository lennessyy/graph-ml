= Breadth-First Search
:description: Overview of TigerGraph's Breadth-First Search algorithm.

Breadth-first Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to explore the vertices
of a graph layer by layer.
It starts at the given vertex and explores
all vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at
the next depth level.

|Characteristic |Value
|Result |Returns all the vertices that are accessible from the source
vertex

|Required input parameters
a|* `+v_type+`: vertex types to
traverse
* `+e_type+`: edge types to traverse
* `+max_hops+`: look only this far from each vertex
* `+v_start+`: source vertex for traversal
* `+print_accum+`: print JSON output
* `+result_attr+`: INT
attr to store results to
* `+file_path+`: file to write CSV output
to
* `+display_edges+`:output edges for visualization

|Result size |V = number of vertices

|Time complexity |O(E+V), E = number of edges, V = number of
vertices.

|Graph types |Directed or undirected edges, weighted or unweighted edges
|===

== Example

In the example below, we run `+tg_bfs+` algorithm from the source vertex
`+alex+` on the social10 graph.

....
# Use _ for default values
RUN QUERY tg_bfs(["Person"], ["Friend"], _, ("Alex","Person"), _, _, _, _) <1>
....
<1> Putting `_` in the position of a parameter will use the default value for that parameter.

Below is the visualized result of the query:
