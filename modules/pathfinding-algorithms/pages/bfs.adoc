****

Breadth-first Search (BFS) is an algorithm used to explore the vertices
of a graph layer by layer.
It starts at the given vertex and explores
all vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at
the next depth level.

== Specifications

[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_bfs(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,INT max_hops=10,
    VERTEX v_start, BOOL print_accum = True, STRING result_attr = "",
    STRING file_path = "", BOOL display_edges = True)
----

== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(V+E)], where stem:[V] is equal to the number of vertices and stem:[E] is equal to the number of edges.

=== Result

Returns all the vertices that are accessible from the source vertex.

=== Result size

The result size is equal to stem:[V], or the number of vertices.

=== Parameters

|(empty string)

|`EDGE e_type`
|Edge types to traverse
|(empty string)

|`INT max_hops`

== Example

In the example below, we run the `+tg_bfs+` algorithm from the source vertex
`+alex+` on the social10 graph.

[source.wrap,gsql]
----
RUN QUERY tg_bfs(["Person"], ["Friend"], _, ("Alex","Person"), _, _, _, _) <1>
----
<1> Putting `_` in the position of a parameter will use the default value for that parameter.

Below is the visualized result of the query.
