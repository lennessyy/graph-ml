= Cycle Component
:description: Overview of TigerGraph's implementation of the Cycle Component algorithm
:stem: latexmath

Algorithm link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/Path/cycle_component/tg_cycle_component.gsql[Cycle Component]

The Cycle Component algorithm finds vertices that are on a cycle.
It can be used as a helper algorithm for the xref:cycle-detection.adoc[] algorithm.
It returns a set of only the vertices which are on at least one cycle, which saves memory compared to finding and returning all cycles.

== Specifications

[.wrap,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_cycle_component(STRING v_type, STRING e_type, BOOL print_accum = TRUE, STRING result_attr =  "", STRING file_path = "")
----

== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(VE)], where stem:[V] is the number of vertices and stem:[E] is the number of edges.

== Space complexity

This algorithm has a space complexity of stem:[O(V)], where stem:[V] is the number of vertices.

== Parameters

|===
|Parameter |Data type |Description

|`v_type`
|`STRING`
|The type of vertex to search for.

|`e_type`
|`STRING`
|The type of edge to search for.

|`print_accum`
|`BOOL`
|Whether or not to print the path to the console.

|`result_attr`
|`STRING`
|The attribute on the vertex that will store the result.

|`file_path`
|`STRING`
|If not empty, write output to this file.
|===

== Result

This query returns the vertices that appear on at least one cycle in JSON format.

== Example

You can run this query on the default Friendship graph included with the Getting Started with Docker tutorial.

image::cycle-component-graph-dark.png[]

In this graph, there is a cycle that includes Tom, Dan, and Jenny. Running tg_cycle_component returns those three vertices.
