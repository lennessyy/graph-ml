= Pathfinding Algorithms
:description: Overview of pathfinding algorithms.

Pathfinding algorithms find the best path(s) between two vertices or among a set of vertices according to a particular rule (shortest unweighted, shortest weighted, lowest cost tree).

The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following pathfinding algorithms:
