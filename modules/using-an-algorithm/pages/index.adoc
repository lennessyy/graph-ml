= Using an Algorithm
:description: Instructions on how to use a GDS algorithm.
:experimental:


This page provides information on how to use a TigerGraph Graph Data Science (GDS) Library algorithm.

All GDS algorithms can be found at https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms[`tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms`] on GitHub in the `algorithms` folder.
The algorithms are divided into several categories.
Each algorithm has its own folder, where you can find the implementation of the algorithm, any user-defined functions required to install the algorithm, or different versions of the algorithm if they exist.


GDS Library algorithms are implemented in GSQL as GSQL queries.
Therefore, the process to run an algorithm query is the same as the process to run any other query.
The names of GDS algorithm queries as provided by the library begin with the prefix `tg_` only to distinguish them from a user-written query.
However, since the library is open-source, you can change the name of the queries to any name of your choosing.


== Check for data or schema constraints
Most algorithm queries in the GDS Library are schema-free, meaning that you are able to run the query on any schema.
However, some algorithms have certain schema or data constraints by nature.
Make sure to read the documentation for the algorithm to determine the following:

* Does the algorithm require edges to be directed/undirected?
* Does the algorithm require edges to be weighted/unweighted?
* Does the algorithm require any vertex type to have an attribute of a certain data type?
* Does the algorithm require your data to have been processed in a certain way before it runs?

For example, xref:classification-algorithms:k-nearest-neighbors.adoc[] runs on graphs with either directed or undirected edges, but the edges must have a weight attribute.

Another example is the xref:node-embeddings:fast-random-projection.adoc[Fast Random Projection algorithm], which expects the vertex type to have an attribute of type `LIST<DOUBLE>` if you want to store the embedding results to your graph data.

== Install necessary UDFs

Some algorithms require the use of user-defined functions (UDF).
The UDF files are included in the same folder as the algorithm itself.

If your query requires a UDF, ensure that the xref:gsql-ref:querying:func/query-user-defined-functions.adoc[UDF has been installed into your TigerGraph system] before creating or installing the query.

If your query does not require a UDF, you can proceed to the next step.

== Create query
If the algorithm you wish to use is not yet installed in your TigerGraph instance, you need to xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc#_create_query[create] and xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc#_install_query[install it].

You can create the query in the following ways:

[tabs]
====
GSQL Shell::
+
--
. Locate the query in the GDS Library GitHub repository.
It is a `.gsql` file named after the query.
. Copy the entire content of the query file, which is the command to create the query, and paste it into a file on the machine running TigerGraph.
. Log in to the GSQL shell as a user with query writing privileges for the graph on which you want to create the query.
. Run `@<filepath>` from the GSQL shell, and replace `<filepath>` with the absolute path to the file where you copied the query.
For example, if your filepath is `/home/tigergraph/query/pagerank.gsql`, run `@/home/tigergraph/query/pagerank.gsql` from the GSQL shell.
--
GraphStudio::
+
--
WARNING: Saving a query in GraphStudio does not create the query in GSQL.

. Locate the query in the GDS Library GitHub repository.
It is a `.gsql` file named after the query.
. Copy the entire content of the query file.
This is the command to create the query.
. Log in to GraphStudio as a user with query writing privileges for the graph on which you want to create the query.
. Click btn:[Global View] in the top-left corner and choose the graph to use.
. Click btn:[Write Queries] on the left side navigation.
Click btn:[+] to add a new query and enter the query name.
This name must be the same as the name in the `CREATE QUERY` command
. Paste the `CREATE QUERY` command into the query and save the query.

== Install query

Installing a query allows the algorithm query to access all features offered by the GSQL Query language.
It also increases the performance of the query.

To install a query, run `INSTALL QUERY <query_name>` in the GSQL shell.
Alternatively, you can click btn:[Install] on the btn:[Write Query] page of GraphStudio.

=== Install query in distributed mode
If you are running the query on a TigerGraph cluster, you may consider installing the query in distributed mode.

In general, distributed mode is likely to improve the performance of a query if the query meets the following conditions:

* The query starts at a very large set of starting point vertices.
* The query performs many hops.

For example, algorithms that compute a value for every vertex or one value for the entire graph should use distributed mode.
This includes PageRank, Centrality, and Connected Component algorithms.

To install a query in distributed mode in the GSQL shell, run command `INSTALL QUERY <query_name> -DISTRIBUTED`.
To install a query in distributed mode from GraphStudio, change the `CREATE QUERY` at the beginning of the command to `CREATE DISTRIBUTED QUERY`, and then click btn:[Install].

== Run query
Once the query has been installed, you can xref:gsql-ref:querying:query-operations.adoc#_run_query[run the query] on your graph data.
Installing a query also xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_run_an_installed_query_post[creates a REST endpoint] you can use to call the query.

Most of the algorithm queries provide multiple output formats.
You usually have the option to output one or more of the following:

* JSON output to console
* CSV output to a file
* Results written to an attribute of vertices or edges
