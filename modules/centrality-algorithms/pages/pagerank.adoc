= PageRank

Algorithm links: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Centrality/pagerank[PageRank]

The PageRank algorithm measures the influence of each vertex on every other vertex. PageRank influence is defined recursively: a vertex's influence is based on the influence of the vertices which refer to it. A vertex's influence tends to increase if (1) it has more referring vertices or if (2) its referring vertices have higher influence. The analogy to social influence is clear.

A common way of interpreting PageRank value is through the Random Network Surfer model. A vertex's PageRank score is *proportional to the probability that a random network surfer will be at that vertex at any given time.* *A vertex with a high PageRank score is a vertex that is frequently visited*, assuming that vertices are visited according to the following Random Surfer scheme:

* Assume a person travels or surfs across a network's structure, moving from vertex to vertex in a long series of rounds.
* The surfer can start anywhere. This start-anywhere property is part of the magic of PageRank, meaning the score is a truly fundamental property of the graph structure itself.
* Each round, the surfer randomly picks one of the outward connections from the surfer's current location. The surfer repeats this random walk for a long time.
* But wait. The surfer doesn't always follow the network's connection structure. There is a probability (_1-damping_, to be precise), that the surfer will ignore the structure and will magically teleport to a random vertex.

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*k)] where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of iterations.

The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

|Input Parameters a|
* *`+STRING v_type+`*: Names of vertex type to use
* *`+STRING e_type+`*: Names of edge type to use
* *`+FLOAT max_change+`*: PageRank will stop iterating when the largest
difference between any vertex's current score and its previous score â‰¤
`+max_change.+` That is, the scores have become very stable and are
changing by less than `+max_change+` from one iteration to the next.
* *`+INT max_iter+`*: Maximum number of iterations.
* *`+FLOAT damping+`*: Fraction of score that is due to the score of
neighbors. The balance (1 - damping) is a minimum baseline score that
every vertex receives.
* *`+INT top_k+`*: Sort the scores highest first and output only this
many scores
* *`+BOOL print_accum+`*: If True, output JSON to standard output
* *`+STRING result_attr+`*: If not empty, store PageRank values (FLOAT)
to this attribute
* *`+STRING file_path+`:* If not empty, write output to this file.
* *`+BOOL display_edges+`*: If true, include the graph's edges in the
JSON output, so that the full graph can be displayed.

 # Use _ for default values
RUN QUERY tg_pageRank("Person", "Friend", 0.001, 25, 0.85, 100 _, _, _, _)
----

We ran pageRank on our test10 graph (using Friend edges) with the following parameter values: damping=0.85, max_change=0.001, and max_iter=25. We see that Ivy (center bottom) has the highest pageRank score (1.12). This makes sense since there are 3 neighboring persons who point to Ivy, more than for any other person. Eddie and Justin have scores of exactly 1 because they do not have any out-edges. This is an artifact of our particular version pageRank. Likewise, Alex has a score of 0.15, which is (1-damping), because Alex has no in-edges.
