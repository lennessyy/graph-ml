****


We all have an intuitive understanding when we say a home, an office, or a store is "centrally located." Closeness Centrality provides a precise measure of how "centrally located" a vertex is. The steps below show the steps for one vertex `v`:

|===
| Step | Mathematical Formula

| 1. Compute the average distance from vertex v to every other vertex:
| stem:[d_{avg}(v) = \sum_{u \ne v} dist(v,u)/(n-1)]

| 2. Invert the average distance, so we have average closeness of v:
| stem:[CC(v) = 1/d_{avg}(v)]
|===

TigerGraph's closeness centrality algorithm uses multi-source breadth-first search (MS-BFS) to traverse the graph and calculate the sum of a vertex's distance to every other vertex in the graph, which vastly improves the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm's implementation of MS-BFS is based on the paper https://db.in.tum.de/~kaufmann/papers/msbfs.pdf[The More the Merrier: Efficient Multi-source Graph Traversal by Then et al].

This algorithm query employs a subquery called `cc_subquery`. Both queries are needed to run the algorithm.

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E)] where stem:[E] is the number of edges.

Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

== Example

Closeness centrality can be measured for either directed edges (from `v` to others) or for undirected edges. Directed graphs may seem less intuitive, however, because if the distance from Alex to Bob is 1, it does not mean the distance from Bob to Alex is also 1.

For our example, we wanted to use the topology of the Likes graph, but to have undirected edges. We emulated an undirected graph by using both `Friend` and `Also_Friend` (reverse-direction) edges.
