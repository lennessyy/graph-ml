****


We all have an intuitive understanding when we say a home, an office, or a store is "centrally located."
Something that is centrally located is roughly equidistant from several destinations.


Closeness Centrality provides a precise measure of how "centrally located" all the vertices are.
The steps below show the steps for one vertex `v`:

|===
| Step | Mathematical Formula

| 1. Compute the average distance from vertex v to every other vertex:
| stem:[d_{avg}(v) = \sum_{u \ne v} dist(v,u)/(n-1)]

| 2. Invert the average distance, so we have average closeness of v:
| stem:[CC(v) = 1/d_{avg}(v)]
|===

This is repeated across all vertices in the graph.

== Notes

This algorithm query employs a subquery called `cc_subquery`.
Both queries are needed to run the algorithm.

The `reverse_e_type` (reverse edge type) parameter is always required.
For undirected edges, use the same value for both `e_type` and `reverse_e_type`.

=== References

TigerGraph's closeness centrality algorithm uses multi-source breadth-first search (MS-BFS) to traverse the graph and calculate the sum of a vertex's distance to every other vertex in the graph, which vastly improves the performance of the algorithm.


The algorithm's implementation of MS-BFS is based on the paper https://db.in.tum.de/~kaufmann/papers/msbfs.pdf[The More the Merrier: Efficient Multi-source Graph Traversal by Then et al].

=== Output

Computes a Closeness Centrality value (FLOAT type) for each vertex, calculated from the average distance between that vertex and every other vertex.

=== Result size

stem:[V], or the number of vertices. One FLOAT value is returned for each vertex.


=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E)] where stem:[E] is the number of edges.

Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

== Example

Closeness centrality can be measured for either directed edges (from `v` to others) or for undirected edges. Directed graphs may seem less intuitive, however, because if the distance from Alex to Bob is 1, it does not mean the distance from Bob to Alex is also 1.

For our example, we wanted to use the topology of a friendship graph, but to have undirected edges. We emulated an undirected graph by using both `Friend` and `Also_Friend` (reverse-direction) edges.
