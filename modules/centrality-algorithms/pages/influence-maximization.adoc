Influence maximization is the problem of finding a small subset of vertices in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence.
There are two versions of the Influence Maximization algorithm.
Both versions find k vertices that maximize the expected spread of influence in the network.
The CELF version improves upon the efficiency of the greedy version and should be preferred in analyzing large networks.

== Notes

The algorithm is implemented based on the following research papers:

* CELF: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/detect-kdd07.pdf[Cost-effective Outbreak Detection in Networks]
* Greedy: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd03-inf.pdf[Maximizing the Spread of Influence through a Social Network]

== Specifications

.CELF
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_influence_maximization_CELF(STRING v_type,STRING e_type, STRING weight, INT top_k, BOOL print_accum = True, STRING file_path = "")
----

.Greedy
[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_influence_maximization_greedy(STRING v_type,
  STRING e_type,STRING weight,INT top_k,
  BOOL print_accum = True, STRING file_path = "")
----

== Time complexity
The greedy version has a complexity of stem:[O(E * k)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of top scores to report.

The CELF version also has a worst-case complexity of stem:[O(E * k)], but generally performs much better with a best-case complexity of stem:[O(E)].

== Results

Returns the ID of the vertices with the highest influence scores along with their scores.


== Parameters
The CELF version and the greedy version of the algorithms share the same set of parameters.
