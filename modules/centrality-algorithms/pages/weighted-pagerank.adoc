= Weighted PageRank

The only difference between weighted PageRank and standard PageRank is that edges have weights, and the influence that a vertex receives from an in-neighbor is multiplied by the weight of the in-edge.

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*k)] where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of iterations.

The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

|*Characteristic* |Value
|Result |Computes a weighted PageRank value (FLOAT type) for each
vertex.

|Input Parameters a|

* *`+STRING v_type+`*: Names of vertex type to use
* *`+STRING e_type+`*: Names of edge type to use
* *`+STRING wt_attr+`*: Name of edge weight attribute
* *`+FLOAT max_change+`*: PageRank will stop iterating when the largest
difference between any vertex's current score and its previous score â‰¤
`+max_change+`. That is, the scores have become very stable and are
changing by less than `+max_change+` from one iteration to the next.
* *`+INT max_iter+`*: Maximum number of iterations.
* *`+FLOAT damping+`*: Fraction of score that is due to the score of
neighbors. The balance (1 - damping) is a minimum baseline score that
every vertex receives.
* *`+INT top_k+`*: Sort the scores highest first and output only this
many scores
* *`+BOOL print_accum+`*: If True, output JSON to standard output
* *`+STRING result_attr+`*: If not empty, store PageRank values (FLOAT)
to this attribute
* *`+STRING file_path+`:* If not empty, write output to this file.
* *`+BOOL display_edges+`*: If true, include the graph's edges in the
JSON output, so that the full graph can be displayed.
