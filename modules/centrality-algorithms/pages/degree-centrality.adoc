****


*Degree centrality* is defined as the number of edges incident upon a vertex (i.e., the number of ties that a node has).

One major application of degree centrality is in cybersecurity, and more generally, network management.

The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information).

== Specifications

....
CREATE QUERY tg_degree_cent(SET<STRING> v_type_set, SET<STRING> e_type_set,
  SET<STRING> reverse_e_type_set, BOOL in_degree = TRUE, BOOL out_degree = TRUE,
  INT top_k=100, BOOL print_results = True, STRING result_attribute = "",
  STRING file_path = "")
....

=== Parameters

|===
|Name |Description | Default value

|`SET<STRING> v_type_set` |A set of vertex types. | (empty set of strings)

|`SET<STRING> e_type_set` |A set of edge types. | (empty set of strings)

|`SET<STRING> reverse_e_type_set` |A set of reverse edge types.
If an edge is undirected, put the edge name in the set as well. | (empty set of strings)

|`BOOL in_degree` |Boolean value that indicates whether to count the
incoming edges as part of a vertex's degree centrality. | True

|`BOOL out_degree` |Boolean value that indicates whether to count the
outgoing edges as part of a vertex's degree centrality. | True

|`INT top_k` |The number of vertices with the highest scores to return. | 100

|`BOOL print_results` |If true, print results to JSON output. | True

|`STRING result_attribute` |If not empty, save the degree centrality score of each
vertex to this attribute. | (empty string)

|`STRING file_path` |If not empty, save results in CSV to this file. | (empty string)

|===

=== Output

The vertices with the highest degree centrality scores along with their scores.

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E)], where stem:[E] is the total number of edges in the graph.

== Example

Suppose we have the following graph:

image::social-graph-2022-10.png[]

Running the query on the graph will show that Dan has the highest degree
centrality:
