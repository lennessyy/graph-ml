****


*Degree centrality* is defined as the number of edges incident upon a vertex (i.e., the number of ties that a node has).

One major application of degree centrality is in cybersecurity, and more generally, network management.

The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information).

== Specifications

....
CREATE QUERY tg_degree_cent(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,
  SET<STRING> re_type, BOOL in_degree = TRUE, BOOL out_degree = TRUE,
  INT top_k=100, BOOL print_accum = True, STRING result_attr = "",
  STRING file_path = "")
....

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E)], where stem:[E] is the total number of edges in the graph.

== Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Description

|`SET<STRING> v_type` |A set of vertex types.

|`SET<STRING> e_type` |A set of edge types.

|`SET<STRING> re_type` |A set of reverse edge types. If an edge is undirected, put
the edge name in the set as well.

|`BOOL in_degree` |Boolean value that indicates whether to count the
incoming edges as part of a vertex's degree centrality.

|`BOOL out_degree` |Boolean value that indicates whether to count the
outgoing edges as part of a vertex's degree centrality.

|`INT top_k` |The number of vertices with the highest scores to return.

|`BOOL print_accum` |If true, print results to JSON output.

|`STRING result_attr` |If not empty, save the degree centrality score of each
vertex to this attribute.

|`STRING file_attr` |If not empty, save results in CSV to this file.

|===

== Return value

The vertices with the highest degree centrality scores along with their
scores.

== Example

Suppose we have the following graph:

image::article-rank-ex.png[]

Running the query on the graph will show that Dan has the highest degree
centrality:
