= Degree Centrality

*Degree centrality* is defined as the number of edges incident upon a
node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has). The degree can be
interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching
whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some
information).

== Specification

....
CREATE QUERY tg_degree_cent(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,
  SET<STRING> re_type, BOOL in_degree = TRUE, BOOL out_degree = TRUE,
  INT top_k=100, BOOL print_accum = True, STRING result_attr = "",
  STRING file_path = "")
....

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time-complexity of stem:[O(E)], where _E_ is the total number of edges in the graph.

== Parameters

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Description |Data type
|`+v_type+` |A set of vertex types. |`+SET<STRING>+`

|`+e_type+` |A set of edge types. |`+SET<STRING>+`

|`+re_type+` |A set of reverse edge types. If an edge is undirected, put
the edge name in the set as well. |``SET`

|`+in_degree+` |Boolean value that indicates whether to count the
incoming edges as part of a vertex's degree centrality. |`+BOOL+`

|`+out_degree+` |Boolean value that indicates whether to count the
outgoing edges as part of a vertex's degree centrality. |`+BOOL+`

|`+top_k+` |The number of vertices with the highest scores to return.
|`+INT+`

|`+print_accum+` |If true, print results to JSON output. |`+BOOL+`

|`+result_attr+` |If not empty, save the degree centrality score of each
vertex to this attribute. |`+STRING+`

|`+file_attr+` |If not empty, save results in CSV to this file.
|`+STRING+`
|===

== Return value

The vertices with the highest degree centrality scores along with their
scores.

== Example

Suppose we have the following graph:

image::article-rank-ex.png[]

Running the query on the graph will show that Dan has the highest degree
centrality:
