Algorithm link: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/Centrality/article_rank[Article Rank]

ArticleRank is an algorithm that has been derived from the PageRank algorithm to measure the influence of journal articles.
Page Rank assumes that relationships originating from low-degree nodes have a higher influence than relationships from high-degree nodes. Article Rank modifies the formula in such a way that it retains the basic PageRank methodology but lowers the influence of low-degree nodes.
The Article Rank of a node v at iteration i is defined as:

Within the formula:

* stem:[N_{in}(v)] are the incoming neighbors and stem:[N_{out}(v)] are the outgoing neighbors of node _v_.
* _d_ is a damping factor in [0, 1], usually set to 0.85.
* stem:[N_{out}] is the average outdegree.

== *Specifications*
[source,gsql]
....
CREATE QUERY tg_article_rank (STRING v_type, STRING e_type,
 FLOAT max_change=0.001, INT max_iter=25, FLOAT damping=0.85, INT top_k = 100, BOOL print_accum = TRUE, STRING result_attr =  "", STRING file_path = "")
....

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*k)], where _E_ = number of edges, _k_ = number of iterations.
The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.


== *Parameters*

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Description |Data type
|`+v_type+` |A vertex type. |`+STRING+`

|`+e_type+` |An edge type. |`+STRING+`

|`+max_change+` |Article Rank will stop iterating when the largest
difference between any vertex's current score and its previous score ≤
`+max_change.+` That is, the scores have become very stable and are
changing by less than `+max_change+` from one iteration to the next.
|`+FLOAT+`

|`+max_iter+` |Maximum number of iterations. |`+INT+`

|`+damping+` |The damping factor. Usually set to 0.85. |`+FLOAT+`

|`+top_k+` |The number of results with the highest scores to return.
|`+INT+`

|`+print_accum+` |If true, print JSON output. |`+BOOL+`

|`+result_attr+` |If true, store the article rank score of each vertex
in this attribute. |`+STRING+`

|`+file_path+` |If true, output CSV to this file. |`+STRING+`
|===

== *Return value*

The article rank score for each vertex.

== *Example*

Suppose we have the following graph:

image::article-rank-ex.png[]

By running Article Rank on the graph, we will see that the vertex with
the highest score is Dan:
