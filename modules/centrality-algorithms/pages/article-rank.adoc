****

ArticleRank is an algorithm that has been derived from the PageRank algorithm to measure the influence of journal articles.

Page Rank assumes that relationships originating from low-degree vertices have a higher influence than relationships from high-degree vertices.
Article Rank keeps the PageRank methodology but modifies the formula to lower the influence of low-degree nodes.

The Article Rank of a node stem:[v] at iteration stem:[i] is defined as:

//image::article-rank.png[]

[stem]
++++
ArticleRank_i(v) = (1-d) + d \sum_{w\in N_{in}(v)} \frac{ArticleRank_{i-1}(w)}{|N_{out}(w)| + \overline{N_{out}}}
++++

Within the formula:

* stem:[N_{in}(v)] are the incoming neighbors and stem:[N_{out}(v)] are the outgoing neighbors of node stem:[v].
* stem:[d] is a damping factor in [0, 1], usually set to 0.85.
* stem:[\overline{N_{out}}] is the average outdegree.

== Specifications
[source,wrap,gsql]
....
CREATE QUERY tg_article_rank (STRING v_type, STRING e_type,
 FLOAT max_change=0.001, INT maximum_iteration=25, FLOAT damping=0.85, INT top_k = 100, BOOL print_results = TRUE, STRING result_attribute =  "", STRING file_path = "")
....


=== Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Description
|`STRING v_type` |A vertex type.

|`STRING e_type` |An edge type.

|`FLOAT max_change` |Article Rank will stop iterating when the largest
difference between any vertex's current score and its previous score ≤
`max_change.` That is, the scores have become very stable and are
changing by less than `max_change` from one iteration to the next.

|`INT maximum_iteration` |Maximum number of iterations.

|`FLOAT damping` |The damping factor. Usually set to 0.85.

|`INT top_k` |The number of results with the highest scores to return.

|`BOOL print_results` |If true, print JSON output.

|`STRING result_attribute` |If not empty, store the article rank score of each vertex in this attribute.

|`STRING file_path` |If not empty, write output to this file.
|===

=== Output

Returns the article rank score for each vertex in descending order.

=== Result size

The result size is equal to stem:[V], the number of vertices, because one score is produced for every vertex in the graph.

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*k)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of iterations.

The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

=== Run commands

==== Schema-Free Query

[source.wrap,gsql]
----
RUN QUERY tg_article_rank (<parameters>)
----

==== Packaged Template Query

[source.wrap,gsql]
----
CALL GDBMS_ALGO.centrality.article_rank (<parameters>)
----

== *Example*

Suppose we have the following graph:

image::article-rank-ex.png[]

By running Article Rank on the graph, we will see that the vertex with
the highest score is Dan:
