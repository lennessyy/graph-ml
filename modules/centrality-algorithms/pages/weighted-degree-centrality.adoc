= Weighted Degree Centrality

Algorithm: link:https://github.com/tigergraph/gsql-graph-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/Centrality/degree/weighted/tg_weighted_degree_cent.gsql[Weighted Degree Centrality]

Degree centrality is defined as the number of edges connected to a vertex.
The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a vertex for catching whatever is flowing through the network.

Weighted degree centrality allows you to assign weights to the edges connected to a vertex.

== Specifications

[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_weighted_degree_cent(STRING v_type, STRING e_type,
    STRING re_type, STRING weight, BOOL in_degree = TRUE,
    BOOL out_degree = TRUE, INT top_k=100, BOOL print_accum = TRUE,

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of ùëÇ(ùê∏), where ùê∏ is the total number of edges in the graph.


== Parameters


|===
|Parameter |Type |Description

|`v_type`
|`STRING`
|Vertex type to traverse.

|`e_type`
|`STRING`
|Edge type to traverse.

|`re_type`
|`STRING`
|Reverse vertex type to traverse and calculate in-degree.

|`weight`
|`STRING`
|The name of the attribute that indicates the weight of the edge.
The attribute itself must be of a numeric type.

|`in_degree`
|`BOOL`
|Whether to count incoming edges when calculating degree centrality.

|`out_degree`
|`BOOL`
|Whether to count outgoing edges when calculating degree centrality.

|`top_k`
|`INT`
|The number of vertices with the highest degree centrality to return.

|`print_accum`
|`BOOL`
|If true, return JSON results to standard output.

|`result_attr`
|`STRING`
|If not empty, save the degree centrality of each vertex to this attribute.

|`file_path`
|`STRING`
|If not empty, output CSV results to this filepath.
