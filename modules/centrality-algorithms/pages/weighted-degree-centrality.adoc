****
Degree centrality is defined as the number of edges connected to a vertex.
The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a vertex for catching whatever is flowing through the network.

Weighted degree centrality allows you to assign weights to the edges connected to a vertex.

== Specifications

[,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY tg_weighted_degree_cent(STRING v_type, STRING e_type,
    STRING re_type, STRING weight, BOOL in_degree = TRUE,
    BOOL out_degree = TRUE, INT top_k=100, BOOL print_accum = TRUE,
    STRING result_attr = "",STRING file_path = "")
----

== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of ùëÇ(ùê∏), where ùê∏ is the total number of edges in the graph.


== Parameters


|===
|Parameter |Description

|`STRING v_type`
|Vertex type to traverse.

|`STRING e_type`
|Edge type to traverse.

|`STRING re_type`
|Reverse vertex type to traverse and calculate in-degree.

|`STRING weight`
|The name of the attribute that indicates the weight of the edge.
The attribute itself must be of type `INT`.

|`BOOL in_degree`
|Whether to count incoming edges when calculating degree centrality.

|`BOOL out_degree`
|Whether to count outgoing edges when calculating degree centrality.

|`INT top_k`
|The number of vertices with the highest degree centrality to return.

|`BOOL print_accum`
|If true, return JSON results to standard output.

|`STRING result_attr`
|If not empty, save the degree centrality of each vertex to this attribute.

|`STRING file_path`
|If not empty, output CSV results to this filepath.

== Return value
The vertices with the highest degree centrality scores along with their scores.
