****

The Betweenness Centrality of a vertex is defined as the number of shortest paths that pass through this vertex, divided by the total number of shortest paths. That is

[stem]
++++
BC(v) =\sum_{s \ne v \ne t}PD_{st}(v)= \sum_{s \ne v \ne t} SP_{st}(v)/SP_{st}
++++

where stem:[PD] is the pair dependency, stem:[SP_{st}]is the total number of shortest paths from node `s` to node `t` and stem:[SP_{st}(v)]is the number of those paths that pass through `v`.

The TigerGraph implementation is based on _A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality by Ulrik Brandes, Journal of Mathematical Sociology 25(2):163-177, (2001)._
For every vertex `s` in the graph, the pair dependency starting from vertex `s` to all other vertices `t` via all other vertices `v` is computed first:

[stem]
++++
PD_{s*}(v) = \sum_{t:s \in V} PD_{st}(v)
++++

Then betweenness centrality is computed as

[stem]
++++
BC(v) =\sum_{s:s \in V}PD_{s*}(v)/2
++++

According to Brandes, the accumulated pair dependency can be calculated as

[stem]
++++
PD_{s*}(v) =\sum_{w:v \in P_s(w)} SP_{sv}(v)/SP_{sw} \cdot (1+PD_{s*}(w)) ,
++++

where stem:[P_s(w)], the set of predecessors of vertex `w` on shortest paths from `s`, is defined as

[stem]
++++
P_s(w) = \{u \in V: \{u, w\} \in E, dist(s,w) = dist(s,u)+dist(u,w) \} .
++++

For every vertex, the algorithm works in two phases.
The first phase calculates the number of shortest paths passing through each vertex.
Then starting from the vertex on the most outside layer in a non-incremental order with pair dependency initial value of 0, traverse back to the starting vertex.

== Notes

This query algorithm employs a subquery called *bc_subquery*.
Both queries are needed to run the algorithm.

=== Output

Computes a Betweenness Centrality value (`FLOAT` type) for each vertex.
The result size is equal to stem:[V], the number of vertices.

=== Time complexity

This algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*V)] where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[V] is the number of vertices.

Considering the high time cost of running this algorithm on a big graph, users can set a maximum number of iterations.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

== Example

In this example, Claire is in the very center of the graph and has the highest betweenness centrality. Six shortest paths pass through Sam (i.e. paths from Victor to all other 6 people except for Sam and Victor), so the score of Sam is 6. David also has a score of 6, since Brian has 6 paths to other people that pass through David.

In the following example, both Charles and David have 9 shortest paths passing through them. Ellen is in a similar position as Charles, but her centrality is weakened due to the path between Frank and Jack.
