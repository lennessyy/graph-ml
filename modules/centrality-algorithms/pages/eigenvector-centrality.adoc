****

*Eigenvector centrality* (also called *eigencentrality* or *prestige
score*) is a measure of the influence of a vertex in a network.
Relative scores are assigned to all vertices in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring vertices contribute more to the score of the vertex in question than equal connections to low-scoring
vertices.
A high eigenvector score means that a vertex is connected to many vertices who themselves have high scores.

== Specifications

....
CREATE QUERY tg_eigenvector_cent(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,
 INT maxIter = 100, FLOAT convLimit = 0.000001, INT top_k = 100,
 BOOL print_accum = True, STRING result_attr = "", STRING file_path = ""
 )
....

=== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*k)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of iterations.

The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

== Parameters

|Name |Description |Data type
|`+v_type+` |Vertex types to assign scores to. |`+SET<STRING>+`

|`+e_type+` |Edge types to traverse. |`+SET<STRING>+`

|`+maxIter+` |Maximum number of iteration. |`+INT+`

|`+convLimit+` |The convergence limit. |`+FLOAT+`

|`+top_k+` |The number of vertices with the highest scores to return.
|`+INT+`

|`+print_accum+` |If true, print results to JSON output. |`+BOOL+`

|`+result_attr+` |If not empty, save the score of each vertex to this
attribute. |`+STRING+`

|`+file_path+` |If not empty, print results in CSV to this file.
|`+STRING+`
|===

== Return value

The stem:[k] top vertices with the highest eigenvector scores in the graph in JSON format.

== Example

Suppose we have the following graph:

image:article-rank-ex.png[]

Running the algorithm on the graph will show that Dan has the highest
centrality score.
