****

*Eigenvector centrality* (also called *eigencentrality* or *prestige score*) is a measure of the influence of a vertex in a network.
Relative scores are assigned to all vertices in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring vertices contribute more to the score of the vertex in question than equal connections to low-scoring vertices.

A high eigenvector score means that a vertex is connected to many vertices who themselves have high scores.

== Specifications

....
CREATE QUERY tg_eigenvector_cent(SET<STRING> v_type, SET<STRING> e_type,
 INT maxIter = 100, FLOAT convLimit = 0.000001, INT top_k = 100,
 BOOL print_accum = True, STRING result_attr = "", STRING file_path = ""
 )
....

== Time complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of stem:[O(E*k)], where stem:[E] is the number of edges and stem:[k] is the number of iterations.

The number of iterations is data-dependent, but the user can set a maximum.
Parallel processing reduces the time needed for computation.

attribute. |`+STRING+`

== Results

Returns an eigenvector centrality score for all vertices of the specified type in the graph.
The results are ordered from most central to least central.

There is an optional parameter, `top_k`, that limits the results to an arbitrary number of vertices with the highest scores in the graph.
This can be useful for larger graphs, since in large graphs there are likely to be many vertices with very low centrality.

The maximum result size is equal to stem:[V], the number of vertices, because one centrality score is calculated for each vertex.

== Example

Suppose we have the following graph:

image:article-rank-ex.png[]

Running the algorithm on the graph will show that Dan has the highest
centrality score.
