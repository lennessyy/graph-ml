= Centrality Algorithms
:description: Overview of centrality algorithms.

Centrality algorithms find the important vertices in a graph based on their connections with other vertices.
A centrality algorithm usually assigns scores to vertices or edges based on how close they are to the center of connection-based activity.
The definition of closeness and what constitutes the center of connection-based activity depend on the algorithm.
