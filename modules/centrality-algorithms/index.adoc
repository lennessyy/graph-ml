= Centrality Algorithms
:description: Overview of centrality algorithms.

Centrality algorithms are one way to determine the importance of a vertex to a graph, based on the importance of a vertex to other vertices.
These algorithms assign a score to a vertex or edge based on some concept of being close to the center of connection-based activity.
