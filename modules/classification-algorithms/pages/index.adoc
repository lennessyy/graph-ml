= Classification Algorithms
:description: Overview of classification algorithms.

Classification algorithms assign a label (class name) to a vertex based on it satisfying the established conditions for membership in that class.
This differs from community (or clustering) algorithms in which there are no pre-established conditions for membership.

The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following classification algorithms:
