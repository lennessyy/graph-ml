:description: Overview of node embedding algorithms.

Node embeddings are vector representations of properties of vertices in a graph. These vectors can be used for machine learning.

The TigerGraph Graph Data Science Library provides the following node embedding algorithms:

//* xref:node2vec.adoc[]
* xref:fast-random-projection.adoc[]
* xref:1.5@pytigergraph:gds:nodepiece.adoc[NodePiece] is a highly scalable node embedding technique.
It is implemented in the pyTigerGraph library.
Using it requires a few additional steps, but it is our most scalable offering.

* *Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism* has been moved to the
xref:classification-algorithms:index.adoc[Classification] category.

* *Node2Vec* has been retired (as of v3.9.2) because it did not meet our standards for efficiency and scalability of memory usage. xref:fast-random-projection.adoc[] is a better alternative.
